# NestJS Microservices [PoC]

Welcome to the NestJS Microservices project. This project is a collection of microservices that are designed to work together to provide a complete solution for a specific business domain.
The microservices are designed to be independent of each other and can be deployed and scaled independently.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v20.15 (npm v10.7.0)
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- For protobuf, you need to have `protoc` installed. You can install it using the following command:

  ```sh
  # macOS
  brew install protobuf

  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
  ```

### Running the project

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd nestjs-microservices
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Build protobuf files:

   ```sh
   # Build the protobuf files
   nx run microservices:build-protobuf
   ```

4. Start microservices:

   ```sh
   # Start required services with docker (database, etc.)
   docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

   # In one shell, start the cyclops microservice
   # Users microservice (HTTP + gRPC API)
   npx nx run cyclops:serve

   # In another shell, start the wolverine microservice
   # Auth microservice (HTTP API)
   npx nx run wolverine:serve
   ```

5. [Optional] Setup projects for development:

   ```sh
   # Setup the projects for development
   # For example: seed databases
   npm run setup:dev
   ```

## Structure overview

The project is structured as a monorepo. Each microservice is a separate package within the monorepo. The monorepo is managed using [nx](https://nx.dev/).

The monorepo is structured as follows:

```sh
.
├── apps
│   ├── cyclops         # Agnostic microservice
│   └── wolverine       # Agnostic microservice
│
├── libs
│   ├── microservices
│   │   └── grpc        # gRPC services/models
│   │
│   ├── modules
│   │   ├── auth        # Auth module
│   │   ├── files        # File management module
│   │   └── users       # User management module
│   │
│   ├── sdk
│   │   ├── api         # API utilities for microservices
│   │   ├── common      # Common utilities for microservices
│   │   └── ...         # Other SDKs
│   │
│   └── shared
│       ├── config       # Configuration management
│       └── utils       # Miscellaneous utilities
│
├── tools
│    ├── eslint         # ESLint configuration of monorepo
│    └── scripts        # Helper scripts for development
│
└── ... other files
```

### Graph

The following graph shows the dependencies between the packages in the monorepo.

  - Automatic generation of TypeScript types
  - Automatic generation of gRPC services and decorators (directly to NestJS)
- Validation of DTOs
- Configuration management
- API utilities
- Swagger documentation
- Solid architecture
